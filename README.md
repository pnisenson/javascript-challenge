# javascript-challenge
For this assignment, we were provided with a HTML page, CSS code, a data.js file and a blank app.js file. The data.js file contained 111 UFO sightings in a dictionary with details including date, city, state, country, shape, and duration of the sighting.

In Part 1, I completed the app.js file to render a table of the data dictionary and have it be filtered by date on button click or hitting the enter button.

In Part 2, I expanded the code to include 5 filters (date, city, state, country, shape). The filters can work individually or all together on button click and after each input is entered (on change).
